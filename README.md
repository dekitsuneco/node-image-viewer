# node-image-viewer
Complicated application which in its core is a gallery app.
# Let's break it down:
* First, server side code is downloading particular set of images from external API.
So to apply the aforesaid, you must run '**npm start**' from <*server*> folder.
* Second, client-side code is creating a theme-toggler at the top, image slider a bit below, and a whole gallery beneath it.
To apply it, you must run another server ('live-server' or 'nodemon' etc) in the *root folder*.

Now the app is ready to explore!
